    Performs a key-recovery attack.

    Some systems may opt to reduce the number of parameters to decrypt a ciphertext by
    setting the IV so it matches the key. Even assuming they don't include the IV with
    the ciphertext, we can recover the key under certain conditions.

    Conditions:
        * CBC is being used
        * The IV and the key are equivalent
        * The user has access to an oracle that returns the decrypted plaintext
