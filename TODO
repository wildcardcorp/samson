CURRENT
---------------
0.2.0
===============
X   Timing attack framework
    OK  Build TimingOracle
    X   Time sync
    X   Techniques to increase sync resolution from a lower resolution oracle


X   Document timing attack setup


0.3.0
===============
X   More encoders/decoders/cryptosystems
    OK  JWK (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#section-3) (https://github.com/latchset/jwcrypto/blob/master/jwcrypto/tests.py)
        OK  RSA
        OK  ECDSA
        OK  OCT/AES-KW

    X   JWK Encryption (key wrapping)


X   OCB
    OK  OCB2
        OK  Auth tag forgery

    X   OCB3


OK  X.509
    OK  Parsing
    OK  Generating certs
    ?   Maybe ECDH


X   Document new parsers
    X   Add class/function documentation


OK  Update README
    OK  Include new features
    OK  Change CBCPaddingOracle attack to use "new" PKCS7


OK  Add CBC tests


X   Composable exploits and ACE
    OK  RUNTIME primitive property/exploit loading
    X   RUNTIME programmatic search
    OK  ACE verified against several manual cryptanalysis test vectors
    X   ACE creates working exploits
    X   ACE correctly detects
        X   Small key size
        X   Non-CSPRNGs
        X   Meet in the middle attacks


X   ACE should be able to register multiple exploits per class

X   samson-py currently requires Python3 + PyPy3 dependencies; fix?

X   Ensure samson installs correctly
