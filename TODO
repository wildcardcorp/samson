CURRENT
---------------
0.2.0
===============
X   Timing attack framework
    OK  Build TimingOracle
    X   Time sync
    X   Techniques to increase sync resolution from a lower resolution oracle


X   Document timing attack setup


0.3.0
===============
X   More encoders/decoders/cryptosystems
    OK  JWK (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517#section-3)
        OK  RSA
        OK  ECDSA

    X   JWK Encryption (key wrapping)


X   OCB
    OK  OCB2
        OK  Auth tag forgery

    X   OCB3


OK  X.509
    OK  Parsing
    OK  Generating certs
    ?   Maybe ECDH


X   Document new parsers
    X   Add class/function documentation
    X   Update README


X   Allow kwargs to pass in to encoding
    OK  OpenSSH can have arbitrary hostnames
    OK  X509Certificate can generate arbitrary RDN sequences/sigs
        OK  Make an RDN parser?

    X   X509Certificate can sign/self-sign
        OK  RSA
        X   DSA
        X   ECDSA
        X   Generate a CA cert and verify with `openssl verify -CAfile ca.crt leaf.crt`


X   Composable exploits and ACE
    OK  RUNTIME primitive property/exploit loading
    X   RUNTIME programmatic search
    OK  ACE verified against several manual cryptanalysis test vectors

    X   ACE correctly detects
        X   Small key size
        X   Non-CSPRNGs
        X   Meet in the middle attacks



X   samson-py currently requires Python3 + PyPy3 dependencies; fix?
OK  samson-py should be able to take in new parameters for exporting (cert details, OpenSSH hostname, encryption)
